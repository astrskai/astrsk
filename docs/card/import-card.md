## Important Notes

- **Acceptable File Formats:** The imported files must be in **PNG** format.
- **Splitting V2/V3 Cards:** When you import a V2 or V3 card, it automatically divides into two separate cards — one Character Card and one Plot Card — so that each piece of information is appropriately categorized.
