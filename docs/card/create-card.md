## Fill in the Card Information

The fields you fill in will define your character's personality or the story's plot. The card creation interface uses several panels to organize this information.

- **For Character Cards,** Character cards consist of Metadata, Character Info, Lorebook, and Variables panels to define your character. See the [Character Card Panels](./character-card.md) guide for a detailed explanation of each panel.
- **For Plot Cards,** Plot cards consist of Metadata, Plot Info, Lorebook, Scenarios, and Variables panels to define your plot. See the [Plot Card Panels](./plot-card.md) guide for a detailed explanation of each panel.
