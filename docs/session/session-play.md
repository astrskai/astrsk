# Session Play

This is the main page where you interact with the AI characters in your session.

## Sending Messages

At the bottom of the page, you will find the message input box. Type your message here and press Enter or the send button to send your message.

## Generating AI Responses

To make an AI character speak, press the button with their name, located above the message input box.

### 1-on-1 Chat

In a session with a single AI character, the AI will also respond automatically after you send a message. You can still use the character's button to manually trigger a response at any time.

### Group Chat

In a group chat with multiple AI characters, you must explicitly press a character's button to make them speak. The AI will not respond automatically.

On the far right of the character buttons, there is also a "Shuffle" button. Pressing this will trigger a response from one of the AI characters at random.

## Editing Messages

You can edit, delete, or reroll any message in the chat history. Hover your mouse over a message, and a control panel will appear at the bottom of that message bubble.

- **Edit:** Allows you to change the content of the message.
- **Delete:** Removes the message from the chat.
- **Reroll:** Generates a new response from the AI for that turn.
