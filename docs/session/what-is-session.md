# Session Manual

## What is a Session?

A session is a **roleplay environment** that combines session-specific settings and chat history with global resources (cards and flows).

## Key Features

- **Cards and flows are global resources**: Sessions reference the same cards and flows that exist in your library
- **Changes to cards and flows affect all sessions using them**: When you modify a card or flow, the changes are reflected in every session that uses them
- **Session-specific settings remain local**: Each session maintains its own chat history, background image, chat styling, and translation settings

Character and plot cards can be easily switched around and modified for dynamic roleplay experience.

## Session Components

### Cards

Cards define the characters and plots within your session. You can add multiple character cards for group chats and a plot card to set the scenario.

### Flow

The flow dictates how the AI processes information and generates responses. It's the "brain" of your session, determining the AI's behavior and interaction style.

### Chat History

This is the record of all messages exchanged within the session. It's unique to each session and is not shared across other sessions.

### Session Settings

These settings are specific to each session and include:
- **Background Image:** The visual backdrop for your roleplay.
- **Chat Styling:** How messages appear in the chat interface.
- **Language & Translation:** Settings for language input and output, including translation options.
