# Connect Providers

Connecting to AI providers in astrsk.ai primarily involves using API Keys. These keys authenticate your application with the provider's services, allowing you to access their models.

## Connecting with API Keys

Most providers require an API Key for connection. You will typically find an input field in the provider setup dialog where you can paste your key.

## Obtaining API Keys

If you don't have an API Key for a specific provider, the connect-provider dialog often includes direct links to the provider's website or documentation where you can generate or find your API Key.

Here's a list of supported providers and where to obtain their API keys:
