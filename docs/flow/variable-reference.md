# Variable Reference

Variables are data that can be used during Flow execution. They contain various information such as session chat history, character information, and more. Each node can utilize variables when executed, and the results of node execution are also stored as variables.

## Types

Variables can contain various types of data. The most basic types are JavaScript primitive types.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `string` | Text values | `Hello. My name is Raphy.` |
| `number` | Numeric values | `42`, `3.14`, `-10` |
| `boolean` | True/false values | `true`, `false` |

In addition to primitive types, there are object types. These objects can be accessed through their internal properties using `.`. Example: `{{char.name}}`

### `Character`

This type represents a character card included in the session. You can access various data defined in the card.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the character. (UUID) |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the character. |
| `description` | `string` | Description of the character. |
| `example_dialog` | `string` | Example dialogue for the character. |
| `entries` | `string[]` | List of activated lorebook entries for this character. |

### `HistoryItem`

This type represents each individual conversation item from previous dialogue within a session.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `char_id` | `string` | ID of the character who sent the message. |
| `char_name` | `string` | Name of the character who sent the message. |
| `content` | `string` | Message content. |
| `variables` | `Record<string, any>` | Final variable state when this message was generated. |

### `Date`

This is a [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) `Date` object representing a specific point in time. It's used to represent a specific moment in the present, past, or future. This object cannot be used standalone and must be converted to strings like "2 minutes ago" or "1 hour ago" through filters like `date_to_relative`.

### `Duration`

This is a [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) `Duration` object representing time intervals. It's mainly used to represent session duration or conversation intervals. This object cannot be used standalone and must be converted to strings like "2 minutes ago" or "1 hour ago" through filters like `date_to_relative`.
