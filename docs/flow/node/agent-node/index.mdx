# Agent node

## Agent Name

The agent's name is primarily used to distinguish between agents. It also serves as a prefix when the agent's output is stored in the context as variables.

When the agent name is converted to a variable prefix, it is transformed to [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). For example, if the agent's name is `Test Agent`, it becomes `test_agent`.

## Select Model

Configure the model to execute the agent. Available models are displayed based on the providers configured in the **[Settings > Providers]** screen.

## Agent Panels

You can configure the agent's details in the following panels:
