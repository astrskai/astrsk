# Astrsk Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Reusability First
Every piece of functionality MUST be written once and reused everywhere. No duplicate implementations allowed. When similar logic is needed in multiple places, extract it into a shared module, hook, utility, or component. This applies to UI components, business logic, data transformations, and API integrations.

**Rationale**: Redundant code increases maintenance burden, introduces inconsistencies, and makes the codebase harder to understand and modify.

### II. Component-Based Architecture
All UI elements MUST be built as reusable components. Components must be self-contained with clear props interfaces, no hardcoded values, and comprehensive documentation. Use composition over inheritance. Every component should do one thing well.

**Rationale**: Component-based architecture enables rapid development, consistent UX, and easier testing while reducing the overall codebase size.

### III. Single Source of Truth
Each piece of data or configuration MUST have exactly one authoritative source. No data duplication across stores, no repeated constants, no multiple definitions of the same type or interface. Use centralized state management and configuration files.

**Rationale**: Multiple sources of truth lead to synchronization bugs, data inconsistencies, and debugging nightmares.

### IV. Clean Code Standards
Code MUST be readable, self-documenting, and follow consistent naming conventions. Functions should be small and focused. Variables and functions must have descriptive names. Complex logic requires clear comments explaining the "why" not the "what". No magic numbers or strings.

**Rationale**: Clean code reduces cognitive load, speeds up onboarding, and prevents bugs caused by misunderstanding.

### V. Test-Driven Development
Tests MUST be written before implementation for all new features and bug fixes. Every public API, component prop, and user interaction requires test coverage. Integration tests for critical user flows are mandatory.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code works as intended, prevents regressions, and serves as living documentation of expected behavior.

### VI. Performance by Design
Performance considerations MUST be part of initial design, not an afterthought. Lazy loading for routes and heavy components is required. Database queries must be optimized. Bundle size must be monitored and minimized. Memoization for expensive computations is mandatory.

**Rationale**: Performance impacts user experience directly. Retrofitting performance is exponentially more expensive than designing for it.

### VII. Type Safety Everywhere
TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled. No use of 'any' type except in exceptional, documented cases. All API responses, database schemas, and component props must be fully typed. Runtime validation for external data is required.

**Rationale**: Type safety catches bugs at compile time, improves IDE support, and serves as inline documentation.

## Code Organization

### Monorepo Structure
The project MUST maintain a clear monorepo structure with distinct packages for different concerns:
- `apps/` for application-specific code
- `packages/` for shared libraries and utilities
- `configs/` for shared configurations
- Clear boundaries between packages with explicit dependencies

### File Organization
Files MUST be organized by feature/domain, not by file type. Related files stay together. Each feature should be self-contained with its own components, hooks, utilities, and tests in the same directory.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
All code changes MUST go through peer review. Reviews verify:
- No code duplication introduced
- Existing utilities/components are reused
- Proper abstractions are created for repeated patterns
- Tests are included and passing
- Performance impact is considered
- Type safety is maintained

### Refactoring Protocol
When duplicate code is identified:
1. Stop current work immediately
2. Extract common functionality to shared module
3. Update all existing usages
4. Add tests for the new module
5. Document the module's purpose and usage
6. Then continue with original task

## Governance

The Constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All code changes must comply with these principles.

### Amendment Process
1. Propose change with clear rationale and impact analysis
2. Team discussion and consensus required
3. Update all affected documentation and templates
4. Provide migration plan for existing code
5. Version bump according to semantic versioning

### Compliance Verification
- All pull requests must verify constitutional compliance
- Automated linting rules enforce where possible
- Code review checklist includes constitution principles
- Regular codebase audits for principle violations
