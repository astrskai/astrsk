  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *walks into office nervously* Hi, I'm Alex Chen, the new junior developer starting today.\n[assistant]: Sam: *warm smile* Welcome! I'm Sam Rivera from Marketing. Let me show you where the coffee machine is.",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: Thanks Sam! Being a junior developer is intimidating. This is my first real tech job.\n[assistant]: Sam: Don't worry! I'm the marketing manager here. Everyone's super friendly. You'll do great!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *at coffee machine* So you've been here long? I'm still learning the codebase as a junior.\n[assistant]: Sam: Two years as marketing manager. The dev team is great - very supportive of juniors.",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *frustrated* My first code review as a junior developer came back with so many comments.\n[assistant]: Sam: *offers chocolate* That's normal! My first marketing campaign got shredded too. You'll learn fast.",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *brightening* You're right. I want to prove myself as a junior developer and move up eventually.\n[assistant]: Sam: You're already fixing bugs in week two! That's impressive for a junior. Coffee tomorrow?",

  // Promotion to Developer (Messages 21-40)
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *excited* I got promoted! No more junior developer - I'm now a full developer!\n[assistant]: Sam: *raises coffee mug* Six months from junior to developer! That's amazing! Let's celebrate!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: I couldn't have done it without your support. From nervous junior developer to confident developer!\n[assistant]: Sam: *whispers* I'm so proud of you... and I really enjoy our coffee talks. Maybe dinner sometime?",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *smiling* Are you asking me on a date? Because yes! Now that I'm not a junior developer, I can afford a nice place.\n[assistant]: Sam: *laughs* I would've said yes even when you were a junior! But let's keep it professional at work.",

  // Senior Developer Phase (Messages 41-60)
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *one year later* Can you believe it? Senior Developer Alex Chen! And dating the amazing Sam Rivera.\n[assistant]: Sam: From junior developer to senior developer in 18 months! And we've been together almost a year now.",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: Being a senior developer means so much responsibility. Leading projects, mentoring juniors...\n[assistant]: Sam: You're handling it beautifully. The CEO mentioned your work yesterday. You're making waves!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *stressed* Senior developer life is non-stop. Meetings, architecture decisions, code reviews...\n[assistant]: Sam: You need balance. Even senior developers need rest. Also... I might become marketing director soon!",

  // Tech Lead Promotion (Messages 61-80)
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *shocked* They want me to be Tech Lead! From junior developer to tech lead in two years!\n[assistant]: Sam: You absolutely should take it! You're already mentoring half the team as senior developer.",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *nervous* Tech Lead means managing the entire dev team. It's so different from coding.\n[assistant]: Sam: *takes hands* You mentored three juniors to promotion. You're ready for this. I believe in you.",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *on one knee* Sam Rivera, you've been with me from junior developer to tech lead. Will you marry me?\n[assistant]: Sam: *crying* YES! A thousand times yes! From coffee machine introduction to this! I love you!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *six months later* Being Tech Lead is harder than I thought. So much more than senior developer work.\n[assistant]: Sam: But you're excelling! And as the new Marketing Director, I totally understand the pressure.",

  // Path to CTO (Messages 81-95)
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: The board is creating a CTO position. They want me to apply. Junior developer to CTO in three years?\n[assistant]: Sam: *excited* You've transformed our entire tech stack! If anyone deserves CTO, it's you!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: We're both up for C-suite positions. You for CMO, me for CTO. Remember when I was just a junior?\n[assistant]: Sam: *nostalgic* Three years ago you walked in as a nervous junior developer. Now look at us!",

  // CTO Achievement (Messages 96-100)
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *holding letter* I got it! Chief Technology Officer! From junior developer to CTO in three years!\n[assistant]: Sam: *screaming* And I'm CMO! We're both C-suite! That nervous junior developer is now running tech!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: Remember our first meeting? You showed the junior developer where the coffee was. Now we run the company together.\n[assistant]: Sam: *tears* From junior developer and marketing manager to CTO and CMO. And soon, husband and wife!",
  "Session TEST-001 conversation:\n[user]: Alex: *reflecting* The journey from junior developer to CTO seems like a dream. But the best part was finding you.\n[assistant]: Sam: Every step - junior, developer, senior developer, tech lead, CTO - we did it together. I love you.",
