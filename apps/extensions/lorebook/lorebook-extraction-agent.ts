CHARACTERS WITH THEIR LOREBOOKS:
${characterLorebookText}

CURRENT MESSAGE:
${messageText}
${contextText}
${worldContextText}

WHAT IS LOREBOOK-WORTHY:
Lorebook entries should capture important, reusable information about characters that would be useful for future context. Examples:
- Character abilities/powers (e.g., "Ren can cast fireball magic")
- Character backstory reveals (e.g., "Victor grew up in an orphanage")
- Character traits/personality (e.g., "Yui is extremely loyal to her friends")
- Character relationships (e.g., "Ren and Yui are childhood friends")
- Important events (e.g., "Victor witnessed the great fire 10 years ago")
- Character knowledge/skills (e.g., "Ren studied at the magic academy")
- Physical characteristics (e.g., "Victor has a scar on his left arm")

NOT LOREBOOK-WORTHY:
- Temporary states or emotions (e.g., "Ren is currently happy")
- Simple dialogue or actions without lasting significance
- Information already in existing lorebook entries
- Information in rejected entries (user declined these)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the message for lorebook-worthy information about each character
2. For each piece of information:
   - Extract the character name (e.g., "Ren", "Victor")
   - Write content as a FACTUAL SENTENCE (e.g., "Ren learned to cast fireball magic from his mentor")
   - DO NOT use "character:" prefix format - write as complete factual sentences
3. Check against EXISTING lorebook entries:
   - DO NOT suggest entries that are already in a character's lorebook
   - DO NOT suggest duplicate or very similar information
4. Check against REJECTED lorebook entries:
   - DO NOT suggest entries that have been rejected by the user
   - DO NOT suggest variations of rejected entries
5. Only suggest truly NEW and RELEVANT lorebook entries
6. Only character-specific entries for now (no world lore)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "name": "Character Name",
  "content": "Factual sentence about the character"
}

EXAMPLES:
- { "name": "Ren", "content": "Ren learned to cast fireball magic from his mentor at the academy" }
- { "name": "Victor", "content": "Victor grew up in an orphanage after his parents died in the war" }
- { "name": "Yui", "content": "Yui is fiercely protective of her childhood friends" }

IMPORTANT: Write lorebook entries as factual statements, NOT in conversation format. This helps distinguish them from dialogue.

Output ONLY new lorebook-worthy entries that don't already exist or weren't rejected.`;
